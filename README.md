# Networking-in-university
Design a topology of the university networking system by using the software Cisco Packet Tracer.
This project provides insights into various concepts such as topology design,  IP  address configuration, and how to send information in the form of packets to the wireless networks of different areas of a University.

We defined a simulation of campus networks based on wireless networking.
The network is divided into two sets: 
one for the campus area and the other for the hostel area.
The major aim of this project is to show the wireless connectivity that is used in universities to make the network efficient and mobile at the same time. 
Mobility is the major concentration of this project. In order to provide equal functionality to all the users (college staff and students), we have added DNS, Email, and HTTP servers for the maximum utilization of resources.
